    reads the distances for each LIDAR module (in mm)
    0 means no object was seen, None means no measurement was taken
    
assertsafe [m/mid/middle/c/centre/center:<dist>] [s/side/o/out/outer:<dist>] [h/half/halfway:<dist>]
    like read, but compares the distances to see whether there is an object closeby
    threshold distances can be specified separately for the sensor in the middle, the sensors on the sides, and the sensors in between
    <dist> in cm
